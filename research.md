### Introducing user constraints in modeling approaches
[Biomedical data Translator - Phase 3 - User Engagement and Impact lead](https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/User-Engagement-Impact-Committee)
Research project in user experience and implementation of biomedical researchers preference feedback to improve modeling performance. 
Milestones:
(1) Identifying and collecting user data to build quantitative measures of performance
(2) Quantifying user needs, expectations, and user factors introducing variance in performance measures of Translator AI models outcomes
(3) Building a standard tracking system to feedback internally quantitative measures of performance into the internal system 
(4) Design tasks-specific test suites for testing purposes
