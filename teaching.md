- June 2025: 
**Présentation: Responsible Artificial Intelligence: Explainability, Data Transparency, and Security for Academic Stakeholders**
This presentation will introduce the main challenges related to the use of artificial intelligence in the academic environment, highlighting the importance of model explainability, transparency and provenance of data sources, as well as the security of personal information. Through concrete examples, we will see how these aspects are essential for the responsible and ethical integration of AI into the daily activities of researchers, teachers, and administrative staff. The goal is to raise participants’ awareness of best practices and tools that enable the secure and transparent use of AI in their professional environment.
**Workshop: Responsible Artificial Intelligence: Explainability, Data Transparency, and Security for Academic Stakeholders**
This workshop offers an introduction to the challenges of artificial intelligence in the academic context, focusing on model explainability, the transparency and traceability of data sources, as well as the security of personal information. Through concrete examples, we will explore how these principles apply to the daily use of AI in research and teaching tasks. The objective is to provide participants with practical tools to identify biases introduced by generative AI and/or to integrate AI in a responsible, ethical, and secure manner into their work.
